						<div class="resources-text">Data science, also known as data-driven science, is an interdisciplinary field about scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms. </div>

						<div class="resources-text">Data scientists use their data and analytical ability to find and interpret rich data sources; manage large amounts of data despite hardware, software, and bandwidth constraints; merge data sources; ensure consistency of datasets; create visualizations to aid in understanding data; build mathematical models using the data; and present and communicate the data insights/findings. They are often expected to produce answers in days rather than months, work by exploratory analysis and rapid iteration, and to produce and present results with dashboards (displays of current values) rather than papers/reports, as statisticians normally do.[25] Data science is not only about technology and mathsâ€”effective data scientists require a combination of technical skills and soft skills to turn data into actionable insight. [26]

						"Data scientist" has become a popular occupation with Harvard Business Review dubbing it "The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century" [6] and McKinsey & Company projecting a global excess demand of 1.5 million new data scientists.[27] Universities are offering masters courses in data science.[28] Shorter private bootcamps are also offering data science certificates including student-paid programs like General Assembly to employer-paid programs like The Data Incubator</div>
