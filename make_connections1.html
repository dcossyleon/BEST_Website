						<h1 class="main-content">You may ask: “Why is meeting people the most important part of learning about a career? Why can’t I just read about careers and find jobs online?”</h1>
						<p class="main_subpage-content-p"><strong>The “practical” reason:</strong> 80% of jobs go to people that employers know personally or through a 3rd party. This is the “hidden job market.” Employees look to people they know first, and to an online job applicant last. Meet people to discover opportunities.</p>
						<p class="main_subpage-content-p"><strong>The deeper reason:</strong> The people you will meet already have the experience to tell you what skills and expertise you need to develop, and whether or not this career is a good fit for you. But they need to get to know you by meeting face-to-face. Then you can start building skills for careers that fit you, a process that takes a lot of time. Start meeting people as early as possible in your training.</p>
