			<div class="resources-text"> “Plans are useless—Planning is everything” - Dwight D. Eisenhower
Planning the next steps for your career is the most important thing you can do while you are in graduate school. This development plan have been created to supplement your current Individual Development Plans (IDPs). A full IDP encompasses your research, academic, career, and skill set development (resources here). While the name IDP uses the word individual, this process should not be done alone. While it is your plan, finding multiple people to talk with about your goals and resources available will lead to a richer and more useful plan. If you need someone to talk with about your plan, email best@emory.edu for a one-on-one meeting with a career coach.</div>
				<ul>
					<li>The goal for this IDP is to help make progress on the foundational elements of career and professional development—which are self-awareness and career exploration.</li>
