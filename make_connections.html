						<h1 class="main-content">How do you get to know someone?</h1>
						<p class="main_subpage-content-p"><strong>You may ask:</strong> “Why is meeting people the most important part of learning about a career? Why can’t I just read about careers and find jobs online?”</p>
						<p class="main_subpage-content-p"><strong>The “practical” reason:</strong> 80% of jobs go to people that employers know personally or through a 3rd party. This is the “hidden job market.” Employees look to people they know first, and to an online job applicant last. Meet people to discover opportunities.</p>
						<p class="main_subpage-content-p"><strong>The deeper reason:</strong> The people you will meet already have the experience to tell you what skills and expertise you need to develop, and whether or not this career is a good fit for you. But they need to get to know you by meeting face-to-face. Then you can start building skills for careers that fit you, a process that takes a lot of time. Start meeting people as early as possible in your training.</p>

						<div class= "resources-head"> Informational Interviewing </div>
						<div class="resources-text"> An informational interview is a great way to reach out to a professional who works in an industry that you're interested in learning more about. Think of it as an informational <i>conversation</i>. It is a meeting where your goal is to learn about the person's career path, the industry, and/or the corporate culture of a potential future workplace. In turn, the employed professional can share his or her insights and make connections for you if possible.<strong> How do I initiate an informational interview?</strong></div>
						<div class="resources-text"><strong>Cold Emailing</strong>
							<ul class="resources-list">
								<li>Use your LinkedIn network, members in professional organizations, or connections from friends of friends to contact</li>
								<li><i>"Hi, I'm currently a graduate student at ____. I am studying ____ and am really interested in ____. I am exploring non-academic career options and I'd love to hear more about what you do. If you are not too busy, I hope we can find a time to chat, via phone or in person."</i></li>
								<li>20-minute phone call or a 30-minute meeting is a reasonable request</li>
								<li>Mention how you found them: If connected through someone you know- mention it!</li>
								<li>Keep the email short</li>
								<li>Email subject is important: Include who you are & what you do
									<ul>
										<li><i>Emory PhD student requesting information</i></li>
										<li><i>Request for career informational interview</i></li>
										<li><i>Meeting request: Referred by [mutual acquaintance] for career advice</i></li>
									</ul>
								<li>Don't look at it as a reporter calling an expert to research an article. Approach it as you would starting a new research project and get the lay of the land.</li>

						<div class="resources-text"><strong>Networking</strong>

							<ul class="resources-list">
								<li>Networking is developing relationships with people who share your professional and personal interests, and alerting them to your goals and abilities</li>
								<li>Networking is NOT schmoozing for a job, and it is not restricted to the slick and superficial</li>
								<li>Who is my network? Anybody you know and feel comfortable talking to can be part of your networks!</li>
								<li>Attend local networking events and prepare an "elevator pitch" (see below) that you can use to summarize what your goals are.
							</ul>
						</div>

						<div class="resources-head"> Elevator Pitches </div>
						<div class="resources-text"> Your elevator pitch is a brief introduction of who you are and your professional interests. Your pitch should highlight your skills, confidence, goals and motivation. It can be used when networking with other professionals in your field of interests, talking to people outside of your field and as a summary for your LInkdedIn bio. Remember to keep it brief (10-60 seconds) and to keep it direct and simple.</div>
						<div class="resources-text"><strong>30 second pitch:</strong>
							<ul class="resources-list">
								<li>Should mention your title, company, and what you do</li>
								<li>Use transferable skills related to what you want to be doing</li>
								<li>How does your job help people?</li>
								<li>What value do you bring?</li>
								<li>Example: <i>Experienced clinical research investigator with subject matter expertise in psychiatry and neurological disorders.  I am driven in increasing the impact of new scientific discoveries to improve patient outcomes. I am most interested in using my scientific expertise to collaborate with healthcare professionals, scientists and non-scientists to increase access to the latest advances in science and medicine.</i></li>
							</ul>
							
							<strong> 60 second pitch:</strong>
								<ul class="resources-list">
									<li>What is your mission as a young professional? </li>
									<li>What are you passionate about? </li>
									<li>What’s the kind of work that doesn’t feel like work because you enjoy doing it so much?</li>
									<li>How do you want to make an impact?</li>
									<li>Example: <strong> NEED EXAMPLE HERE</strong></li>
								</ul>

						<div class="resources-head"> Professional Associations & Societies </div>
						<div class="resources-text"> Professional societies are not just for conferences and newsletters. They provide an entire community of people who you could potentially make connections with. Once you've joined and paid your dues, you have access to the member directory, job boards, professional development services, leadership opportunities within the organization, and ability to apply for special awards like travel grants. You can leverage them in your career development by:</div>
						<ul class="resources-list">
							<li>Contacting their Membership Coordinator and requesting a phone appointment. Let them know you'd like to get involved and let them know your career path. They will suggest ways for you to take on leadership roles, and you'll be jumpstarting your networking and your involvement in the field.</li>
							<li>Posting your resume/ CV in their "banks" and check job postings that may not be publicized elsewhere.</li>
							<li>Checking out the member directory and seeing where the members work. Identify people you may be interested in collaborating with.
